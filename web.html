            <p class="text-small">Human being has done wonders with the progress of technology in the last century.
                 Technology has put spectacular tools and resources in our hands to make our lives ever so convenie
                 nt. New findings in the technical field are so frequent that it has become hard for many to catch 
                 up with the pace of inventions.As fascinating as these technical wonders seem today, the stories 
                 behind them are even more interesting. Here are ten such amazing little knownfacts about the tech
                 nology we all use almost every day.</p>

            <p class="tech ">* Water Integrator — a computer that ran on water </p>
            <p class="tech2 ">1.Vladimir Sergeevich Lukyanov built the world’s first computer 
                in 1936 that solved differential equations in partial derivatives. The amazing
                 fact is that the machine was driven by water.<br>2.The construction company that 
                 Lukyanov worked with was unable to find a solution for the cracks that used to 
                 happen in concretes during winter’s sub-zero temperature. To understand the the
                 rmal process better, Lukyanov researched the temperature conditions in concrete
                  masonry. Finally, he built the water integrator machine that could plot graphs 
                  and help visualize the thermal process.<br>3.Manufacturing plants, research orga
                  nizations, and educational institutes used the water computers well into the
                  1970s. The use of these hydraulic integrators diminished once the digital compu
                  ters became more powerful and convenient to use. </br> </p>

            <p class="sim">* The first computer mouse was called ‘X-Y Position Indicator for Display Systems’
            </p>
            <p class="sim2 ">1. The world’s first computer mouse was invented at Stanford Research Institute 
                (SRI) in the 1960s. The equipment was called “X-Y position indicator for displays”.,<br>2. Douglas
                 Engelbart and Bill English are credited with the invention of the mouse. The story that Xerox
                  APAC invented the mouse is a myth. Engelbart demoed the mouse first time in 1968 using the Xerox
                   Alto computer. He termed the demo as ‘Mother of all demos”.<br>3.The name ‘Mouse' was coined for the
                    instrument as the cable sticking out of it reminded Engelbart of a rodent’s tail. </br> </p>

            <p class="game" >* Amazon.com is not the original name of the website </p>
            <p class="game1 ">1.Jeff Bezos tried several different names for his business 
                before he finalized on Amazon. The very first name he registered was Cad
                abra Inc. After some feedback about the name being too obscure; the entr
                epreneur decided to change the name to something different.<br>2. Bezos regi
                stered his website with many other names before arriving at the current v
                ersion — amazon.com — that is recognized worldwide. Some of the earlier d
                omain names were aard.com, awake.com, browse.com, bookmall.com, and relent
                less.com. Among all these names, he still owns the name relentless.com. The
                 site relentless.com however, redirects to amazon.com today.</br></p>

            <p class="life ">* QWERTY keyboard was designed to slow down the typing speed</p>
            <p class="life2 ">1.People boast about their writing speed on a typewriter or key
                board. It is even a competitive advantage for some jobs to have faster and
                 accurate typing skills. But do you know the current layout of the QWERTY
                  keyboards is the outcome of a solution designed to slow down the typing 
                  speed?<br>2. The initial versions of typewriters made in the 1870s had few
                   technical issues. The metal arms, which hold the characters, used to clash
                    and jam if the keys were pressed in rapid succession or if a typist pressed
                     the adjacent keys simultaneously.<br>3.To avoid the problem and have a better 
                     typing experience, Christopher Latham Sholes made many design alterations to
                      the keyboard layout. The current layout of the QWERTY keyboards was finally
                       designed by E. Remington and Sons, which solved the problem of jammed type
                        bars.</br></p>
